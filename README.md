# ESP32_Blink
very simple esp32 DevBoard arduino blink program

super duper simple - only to check if esp32 is running and build-in LED is working

Please take care to use correct pinout

  **nano32:**  #define LED_BUILTIN 16
  **lolin32:** #define LED_BUILTIN 2
  **espea32:** #define LED_BUILTIN 5
